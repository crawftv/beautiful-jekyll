Hi, I'm Crawford Collins, aspiring data scientist. I want to help your organization succeed.

### Finance
I've been interested in using data to solve problems since reading Freakonomics in middle school. I switched from studying economics to finance after learning about quantitative finance. I worked in the finance industry for over three years and passed my first CFA test.
