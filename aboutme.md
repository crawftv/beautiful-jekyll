Hi, I'm Crawford Collins, aspiring data scientist/analyst. I want to help your organization succeed.

### Sports
Sabermetrics was one of my first statistical interests. In fact, I did not even like baseball until I was able to follow the season with an eye for averages. My sports interests are decision making and knowing when to trust data or what data to trust. 

### Finance
I've been interested in using data to solve problems since reading Freakonomics in middle school. I switched from studying economics to finance after learning about quantitative finance. I worked in the finance industry for over three years and passed my first CFA test.
