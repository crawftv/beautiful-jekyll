# Chess openings for Beginners

## A Statistical Approach

Statistics show that low-rated chess players often lose the game before it starts. The opening moves from these players differ from high-rated players. Players that are new to the game are often given bad advice, setting their progression back. Using statistics to analyze openings will help low-rated players improve. 

### Topics to Explore

*   Strongest first moves for white
*   Countering 1\. e4
*   Show the differences between low-rated, high-rated, and the world champions

### Countering the Conventional Wisdom

Beginners often study weaker moves that are not played at higher levels. The [first google-search result  ](https://www.chess.com/article/view/the-best-chess-openings-for-beginners)for openings contains a list of five openings. But in 15 world [championship games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Chess_Championship_2018#Regular_games), only one from this list was played. Magnus Carlsen played the Sicilian Defense (c5) 7 times against Caurana's 1.e4. 

### Next Steps

*   Make a larger database of chess games for all elo's
*   Make a database of championship games.
*   I want to make a program that shows popularity and win-rates of  openings as a user plays through them.
